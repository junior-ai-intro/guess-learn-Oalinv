Introduction to Reinforcment Learning

# abstract
A six-week high school course that teaches reinforcement learning, by example, requiring only beginner-level Python and 10th-grade math.

Can be taught in software only (using a virtual turtle-bot), or as a combined course in computer science and engineering.

Answers the question: how can the exact same program learn to traverse a maze, play tic-tac-toe, and drive a robot toward a destination?

(for secondary school, no experience needed)

# requirements: computer science track

Lessons in this repo run under: Jupyter Notebook, see http://jupyter.org
Jupyter is part of Ananconda, available for free: https://www.anaconda.com/download

The course takes a step-by-step approach, starting with simple examples and building toward playing tic-tac-toe using <b>Q-Learning</b>, a common reinforcement learning algorithm.

Just install Jupyter Notebook, download or clone the course, launch the notebook and start with lesson 1.

# requirements: engineering track

We will post sample STL files to build a self-learning turtle-bot soon.
